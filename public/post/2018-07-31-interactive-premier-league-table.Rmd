For my inaugural blog post I decided I would step into the world of animated graphics for the first time. I was inspired by the presentation that Thomas Lin Pedersen gave at the UseR! conference on [gganimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21ZWDrTukEs) and this has motivated me to attempt animating my very own first gif.

So the first thing we need to do is install the relevant packages t

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(footballR)
library(tidyverse)
library(gganimate)
library(ggimage)
```
