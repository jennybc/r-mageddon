On my journey to creating my animated Premier League table in my [previous post](https://r-mageddon.netlify.com/post/interactive-premier-league-table/), I noticed a lot of examples for creating gifs using the [magick package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/magick.pdf). The gist behind the majority of these examples was to create a sequence of snapshots which could be combined together to create animations. Whilst not quite as seamless as gganimate, it appears to be much more versatile.

So I thought I would try and make one. I had a number of ideas, but eventually I stumbled across a [FOI request](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/populationbyagegenderandethnicity) that contained a great dataset containing the [population demographics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland/mid2015/ukandregionalpopulationestimates18382015.zip) of the UK going back to 1970. 

A classic way to visualise this data is by using a population pyramid and my idea of a twist was to add an extra dimension and animate this pyramid over time.

Lets load some packages.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(magick)
```

Now we have all the tools needed. As the data was in a stats publication, it was fairly computer unfriendly, so a fair amount of data wrangling was required. I decided to use the Single Year of Age (SYOA) dataset for the UK 1970 - 2015.  This gave a good chunky dataset to work with and yet still covers the entire UK. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

data <- 
  ## Read the excel data in, skipping the "All Ages" data completely
  read_excel("UK Population Estimates 1838-2015.xls", sheet = 4, skip = 96) %>%
  ## Filter away unnecessary data 
  filter(!is.na(Name)) %>%
  filter(Code != "Code") %>%
  filter(Age != "All Ages") %>%
  ## We want a numeric column, so replaced 85 / 85+ with 85
  mutate(Age = ifelse(Age == "85 / 85+", 85, Age)) %>%
  ## We group by age, as it is replicated across the two genders, and we can use this to distinguish one from the other
  group_by(Age) %>%
  mutate(gender = 1:n()) %>%
  mutate(gender = ifelse(gender == 1, "Male", "Female")) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ## Gather all the variable columns into one year variable to make this a tidy dataset
  gather(year, pop, 4:48) %>%
  ## Only keep the last 4 characters to give us a year, which we can convert to numeric
  mutate(year = as.numeric(str_sub(year, -4))) %>%
  mutate(age = as.numeric(Age), Age = NULL) %>%
  mutate(pop = as.numeric(pop)) %>%
  ## Make the Male population negative so we can use this in our ggplot
  mutate(pop = ifelse(gender == "Male", 0-pop, pop)) %>%
  mutate(pop_m = pop/10^6)
```

Now we have a nice tidy dataset of UK population demographics over the past 30 years. Next we need to create a population pyramid from our data. Google gave me plenty of examples to follow but I found this [one](http://marquess.me/2018/04/14/population_pyramids.html) particularly helpful.

However my first attempt didn't go so well...

I finally got there however

![1971 UK Population Pyramid](/img/1971.png)

Using the following `ggplot2` code


```{r, eval = FALSE}
data %>%
    filter(year == 1971) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = age, y = pop_m, fill = gender)) +   
    geom_col(width = .85) +   
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-1,1,0.1),labels = c(10:0, 1:10)) +
    coord_flip() + 
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10), labels = seq(0, 100, 10)) +
    labs(title=paste0("UK Population in ", x), y = "Population (100,000s)", x = "Age", caption = "Source: ONS   Chart by @tomwestlake121") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5),
          axis.ticks = element_blank()) +   
    scale_fill_manual(values=c("red", "navy")) +
    theme_tufte(base_size = 12, base_family="Avenir") 
```

After this it was simply a matter of turning this plot code into a function and adding the necessary `magick` parts! I followed the example found within the magick introduction vignettes, within the [animation section](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html#animation)

So I must admit, I don't quite understand all the theory behind this technique yet. But hey it works, its magic! So somehow R knows after I call the `image_graph` function to remember all the plots I make and then piece them together in order. You then call `image_animate` which formulates the gif and then save it using `image_write` when I'm making plots and seems to save them and then. Pretty cool huh. Anyway so you can see the code I used below.

```{r, eval=F}

img <- image_graph(800, 600, res = 96)

pyramid_plot<- function(x){
  p <- data %>%
    filter(year == x) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = age, y = pop_m, fill = gender)) +   # Fill column
    geom_col(width = .85) +   # draw the bars
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-1,1,0.1),labels = c(10:0, 1:10)) +
    
    coord_flip() +  # Flip axes
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10), labels = seq(0, 100, 10)) +
    labs(title=paste0("UK Population in ", x), y = "Population (100,000s)", x = "Age", caption = "Source: ONS   Chart by @tomwestlake121") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5),
          axis.ticks = element_blank()) +   # Centre plot title
    scale_fill_manual(values=c("red", "navy")) +
    theme_tufte(base_size = 12, base_family="Avenir") #+ transition_manual(year)#
  p
}
map(1971:2015, pyramid_plot)
dev.off()
animation <- image_animate(img, fps = 5)
image_write(animation, "tom-uk-pyramid-5 fps.gif")

```


And the final product:

![Animated UK Population Pyramid](/img/tom-uk-pyramid-5 fps.gif)


In conclusion, after I got my head around the magic happening and just accepted it, it followed quite a logical process. I particularly like how easy it was to alter parameters such as fps,  resolution and the dimensions. These will obviously exist within the gganimate package, I just need to spend more time familiarising myself with the lexicon.



P.S. The keen-eyed among you will notice a weird data anomaly in the 1980s, for the 80-90 age group. This was because the data stopped at 85 years of age within this time period and I fudged a correction into the data to make the animation appear more seamless. The actual animation should look like below, but I found this to be quite jarring:
