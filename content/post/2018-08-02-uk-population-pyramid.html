<p>On my journey to creating my animated Premier League table in my <a href="https://r-mageddon.netlify.com/post/interactive-premier-league-table/">previous post</a>, I noticed a lot of examples for creating gifs using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/magick.pdf">magick package</a>. The gist behind the majority of these examples was to create a sequence of snapshots which could be combined together to create animations. Whilst not quite as seamless as gganimate, it appears to be much more versatile.</p>
<p>So I thought I would try and make one. I had a number of ideas, but eventually I stumbled across a <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/populationbyagegenderandethnicity">FOI request</a> that contained a great dataset containing the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland/mid2015/ukandregionalpopulationestimates18382015.zip">population demographics</a> of the UK going back to 1970.</p>
<p>A classic way to visualise this data is by using a population pyramid and my idea of a twist was to add an extra dimension and animate this pyramid over time.</p>
<p>Lets load some packages.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(magick)</code></pre>
<p>Now we have all the tools needed. As the data was in a stats publication, it was fairly computer unfriendly, so a fair amount of data wrangling was required. I decided to use the Single Year of Age (SYOA) dataset for the UK 1970 - 2015. This gave a good chunky dataset to work with and yet still covers the entire UK.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data &lt;- 
  ## Read the excel data in, skipping the &quot;All Ages&quot; data completely
  read_excel(&quot;UK Population Estimates 1838-2015.xls&quot;, sheet = 4, skip = 96) %&gt;%
  ## Filter away unnecessary data 
  filter(!is.na(Name)) %&gt;%
  filter(Code != &quot;Code&quot;) %&gt;%
  filter(Age != &quot;All Ages&quot;) %&gt;%
  ## We want a numeric column, so replaced 85 / 85+ with 85
  mutate(Age = ifelse(Age == &quot;85 / 85+&quot;, 85, Age)) %&gt;%
  ## We group by age, as it is replicated across the two genders, and we can use this to distinguish one from the other
  group_by(Age) %&gt;%
  mutate(gender = 1:n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(gender = ifelse(gender == 1, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;)) %&gt;%
  ungroup() %&gt;%
  ## Gather all the variable columns into one year variable to make this a tidy dataset
  gather(year, pop, 4:48) %&gt;%
  ## Only keep the last 4 characters to give us a year, which we can convert to numeric
  mutate(year = as.numeric(str_sub(year, -4))) %&gt;%
  mutate(age = as.numeric(Age), Age = NULL) %&gt;%
  mutate(pop = as.numeric(pop)) %&gt;%
  ## Make the Male population negative so we can use this in our ggplot
  mutate(pop = ifelse(gender == &quot;Male&quot;, 0-pop, pop)) %&gt;%
  mutate(pop_m = pop/10^6)</code></pre>
<p>Now we have a nice tidy dataset of UK population demographics over the past 30 years. Next we need to create a population pyramid from our data. Google gave me plenty of examples to follow but I found this <a href="http://marquess.me/2018/04/14/population_pyramids.html">one</a> particularly helpful.</p>
<p>However my first attempt didn’t go so well…</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/LOL.png" alt="Pyramid Fail" />
<p class="caption">Pyramid Fail</p>
</div>
<p>I finally got there however</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/1971.png" alt="1971 UK Population Pyramid" />
<p class="caption">1971 UK Population Pyramid</p>
</div>
<p>Using the following <code>ggplot2</code> code</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
    filter(year == 1971) %&gt;%
    ggplot(aes(x = age, y = pop_m, fill = gender)) +   
    geom_col(width = .85) +   
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-1,1,0.1),labels = c(10:0, 1:10)) +
    coord_flip() + 
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10), labels = seq(0, 100, 10)) +
    labs(title=paste0(&quot;UK Population in &quot;, x), y = &quot;Population (100,000s)&quot;, x = &quot;Age&quot;, caption = &quot;Source: ONS   Chart by @tomwestlake121&quot;) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5),
          axis.ticks = element_blank()) +   
    scale_fill_manual(values=c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;navy&quot;)) +
    theme_tufte(base_size = 12, base_family=&quot;Avenir&quot;) </code></pre>
<p>After this it was simply a matter of turning this plot code into a function and adding the necessary <code>magick</code> parts! I followed the example found within the magick introduction vignettes, within the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html#animation">animation section</a></p>
