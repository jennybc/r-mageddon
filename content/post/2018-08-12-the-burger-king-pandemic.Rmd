Whilst I was rooting around for inspiration, my girlfriend suggested I should do a post about food, quickly followed up by "burgers!!!". So a few google searches later and I decided to create an animated map, showing all the countries of the world that had at least one Burger King store.

I'm particularly chuffed that I've managed to combine a multitude of really cool packages in this post. We've got:

* Data scraped off Wikipedia using the `rvest` [package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/rvest.pdf) in conjunction with the `purr` [package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/purrr/purrr.pdf).
* Some classic data manipulation using the wonders of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
* Using the `glue` [package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glue/glue.pdf) to format and interpolate strings.
* Creating a geospatial visualisation using the new `ggplot2` [release](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), with the `sf` [package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/sf.pdf) and obtaining data from the `rnaturalearth` [package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rnaturalearth/README.html).
* Animating the visualisation using the `gifski` [package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gifski/gifski.pdf)

Ok so lets get started.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(sf)
library(glue)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(gifski)
```


Firstly I've located the data I want, a Wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_Burger_King_franchises) that lists the countries with Burger King franchises. 

```{r}
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_Burger_King_franchises"
```

Now to scrape the data from each table we need to know the Xpath or CSS selector. Normally I would use the Selector Gadget chrome addin to get the selector, (Ã  la this [blog](http://categitau.com/using-rvest-to-scrape-data-from-wikipedia/)), but I couldn't get it to work. So I inspected the element of the first table and got `'//*[@id="mw-content-text"]/div/table[2]')`. A quick scroll down and I figured out I want tables 2 - 8. So to iterate through these 7 tables, I constructed a function to extract the data. 

```{r}
extract_table_df <- function(table_no){
  table <- url %>%
    read_html() %>%
    html_nodes(xpath = glue('//*[@id="mw-content-text"]/div/table[{table_no}]')) %>%
    html_table()
  table_df <- table[[1]] %>%
    mutate(Yearentered = as.character(Yearentered))
}
```

Now we can use this function combined with the `purrr` function `map_dfr` to iterate through the 8 tables and bind them together.

```{r}
data <- map_dfr(2:8, extract_table_df)
glimpse(data)
```

A quick inspection of the data shows a few things. We have unexpectedly brought the reference numbers with us, which makes the year column wrong and some tables had country/territory, whilst others simply contained country. And some observations have no year at all.

So lets fix that!

```{r}
tidy_data <- data %>%
  mutate(country = ifelse(is.na(Country), `Country/territory`, Country)) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(str_sub(Yearentered, end=4))) %>%
  filter(!is.na(year)) %>%
  select(-Notes)
```

Now we have the data as we need it, right?

Lets now get the spatial data we need to plot the results. This comes from the very handy `rnaturalearth` package.

```{r}
countries_sf <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")
```

A quick glimpse at the data shows a `name_en` variable that should hopefully match with our `country` variable in our previous dataset. However what if some of the country names don't match up? 

```{r}
mismatches <- tidy_data %>%
  anti_join(countries_sf, by  = c("country" = "name_en"))
mismatches
```

Uh-oh, 4 countries don't match up. As its a small amount it seemed appropriate to define a new dataset for these countries. 

Ok so what are the names used within `countries_sf` dataframe?

```{r}
unique(countries_sf$name_en)
```

We can see from this that the countries do exist within the dataset, they just need renaming. So lets define this new dataset.

```{r}
country_match <- tribble(
  ~country, ~sf_country,
  "United States", "United States of America",
  "Macedonia", "Republic of Macedonia",
  "Timor-Leste", "East Timor",
  "China", "People's Republic of China")
country_match
```

We can now completely join the spatial data to the important data.

```{r, message = FALSE}
joined_data <- 
  tidy_data %>%
  left_join(country_match) %>%
  mutate(country = ifelse(is.na(sf_country), country, sf_country)) %>%
  left_join(countries_sf,  by  = c("country" = "name_en"))
```

Now we have all of data in one dataframe!

Firstly lets show a quick plot of the countries, using ggplot and sf.

```{r}
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = countries_sf) 
```

And now lets pull all the pieces together.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot_fun <- function(open_year){
p <- ggplot() + 
  ## Add the background countries, but filter away Antarctica because it is unecessary.
  geom_sf(data = filter(countries_sf, name_en != "Antarctica")) + 
  ## Add the countries data, filtering so countries only appear after the first burger king has opened
  geom_sf(data = filter(joined_data, year <= open_year), fill = rgb(236, 28, 36, maxColorValue = 255)) + 
  ## Change the theme so we don't get a background plot or axes. The coord_sf part is a workaround to a current bug that makes gridlines appear.
  theme_void() + coord_sf(datum=NA) + guides(fill=FALSE) + 
  ## Stitch the year to the title with glue
  labs(title = glue("    Countries with a Burger King, year: {open_year}"),
       subtitle = glue("      Count of countries: {nrow(filter(joined_data, year <= open_year))}"))
print(p)
}
```

Now to save the gif to our working directory.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
save_gif(walk(min(joined_data$year):max(joined_data$year), plot_fun), delay = 0.5, gif_file = "animation.gif")
```

And we get the final output:

![Burger King Animation](/img/bk.gif)


P.S. I did quickly briefly add in a `transition_time(year)` using gganimate, just to experiment and see what happenes. Surprisingly it did make something!
